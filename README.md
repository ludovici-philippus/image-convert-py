# Image Convert

## Requirements

- Python 3
- PIL
  (Use: `pip install pillow` on Terminal after you install python, to install PIL)

## Installation

### Windows
If you want to have acess to the image-convert through all your system, you can put it in `C:\Windows\System32`

### Linux
You can put it in `/usr/local/bin`

In both cases, you can also create a custom path directory to not use the System-made directories.

## Usage

./convert.py [IMG [IMG_02] [IMG_03] [...]]  [FILE_FORMAT] [QUALITY (optional)]
